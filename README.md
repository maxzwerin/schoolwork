# **SCHOOLWORK**
_an archive of some cool (and hopefully useful) work I have done_

## how to run programs (on linux)
compile with: _cc FILENAME.c_
add _-lm_ to link with math library
add _-lX11_ to link with X11 graphical library

this will create an executable _a.out_
run the program with _./a.out_

## **layout**
### **TOOLS**
- FPToolkit : a simple set of graphical tools
- matrix_tools : some useful matrix manipulation tools for 2D and 3D usecases

### **GRAPHICS**
- all graphics labs (poorly documented)
- XYZ files

NOTE: most of the labs require XYZ files to be passed in when running the executable, for example
> ./a.out XYZ/torus.xyz

### **NUMERICAL**
- all numerical analysis labs
- labs with _m_ allow the user to drag points
- test files for labs 01 and 02
